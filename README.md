# QGIS_functions


Just a few functions I wrote for work to test the performance of QGIS vs MapInfo.

The functions replicate existing functions we have in MapBasic (for MapInfo) so I was tasked with coding some python
equivalents to run in QGIS.

After some performance testing I found that for this particular dataset (which wasn't very large) the timings between MapInfo
and QGIS were pretty similar.
